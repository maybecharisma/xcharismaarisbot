# ArsBot
The idea behind ArsBot is everything that a good bot needs
Which are the moderation system and the fun system, and most of the bots
Are not providing both of them, Until we thought about ArsBot.
What can we get with 2+ months of thinking and developing? So we came out with
final "prototype" it was poor with 15 commands but we knew we dont need to give
up, After SQL courses and huge improvement at my Javascript / Coding skills
Just after 0.5 month we came out with a beautiful bot more than 60 commands
and all made by â™¥

# How To Use?
Well, we are always thinking about the "customer" so we are thinking EZ PZ
We can start by typing `~help` and we will get a "huge" command list that
But before of that, Our bot will detect if the server has `economy mode` enable
And will send the right form of help you can see that all of the commands has
Descriptions that are very easy to read and understand.

# Economy Mode
So the `"Big Deal"` the economy mode, Maybe you are asking yourself "Artz, WTF Is Economy Mode"
Let me answer on that question,
Economy mode is like a small RPG game but our's is special!
ArsBot's economy mode is all about `No limits` we will take you to a life of
A drug dealer that will work his way up to the best farm on the gang('The server')
After you got to the final farm and you are rich
SPOILER => New features will be unlocked ('Mid development')
